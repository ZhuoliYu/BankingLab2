1.Abstraction
The purpose of abstraction is to hide some complicated details. 
It can aslo achieve some advanced logic beyond abstract. 
This can help users to access and see information clearly and conviently.

2.Inheritance
It can be transfered from one class to a different class. 
So that it can share one same property and method. 
This layer structure inherits from parent class to child class.

3.Encapsulation
Combining variable and methods together inside of a capsule. 
This means encapsulation bind data property and methods to a certain object and limit the inside accessing permission.

4.Polymorphism
It can be used in an over-ride function.
They share a same input but can be led to different type of data.  
Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface.
